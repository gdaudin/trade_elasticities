We also propose a new method to estimate sectoral trade elasticities consistent with any trade model that delivers a multiplicative gravity equation. We apply our model and use our estimated elasticities to identify the impact of NAFTA's tariff reductions. We find that Mexico's welfare increases by 1.31\%, U.S.'s welfare increases by 0.08\%, and Canada's welfare declines by 0.06\%. We find that intra-bloc trade increases by 118\% for Mexico, 11\% for Canada, and 41\% for the U.S. We show that welfare effects from tariff reductions are reduced when the structure of production does not take into account intermediate goods or input\textendash output linkages. Our results highlight the importance of sectoral heterogeneity, intermediate goods, and sectoral linkages for the quantification of the welfare gains from tariffs reductions.},

We construct and employ a new, large, disaggregated tariff dataset and then apply a 189-country, 15-sector version of our model in order to quantify the trade, entry, and welfare effects of trade liberalization over the period 1990\textendash 2010. We find that the impact on firm entry was larger in Advanced Economies relative to Emerging and Developing Economies; that more than 90\% of the gains from trade are a consequence of the reductions in MFN tariffs (the Uruguay Round); and that for some countries, particularly some Emerging and Developing Economies, there are additional gains from a further move to complete free trade. The countries which would gain from the elimination of tariffs have a strong rank correlation with those that gain from a negative optimal tariff, which comprise one-quarter of the countries in the world.},

  abstract = {[The Ricardian model predicts that countries should produce and export relatively more in industries in which they are relatively more productive. Though one of the most celebrated insights in the theory of international trade, this prediction has received little attention in the empirical literature since the mid-1960s. The main reason behind this lack of popularity is the absence of clear theoretical foundations to guide the empirical analysis. Building on the seminal work of Eaton and Kortum (2002, "Technology, Geography, and Trade", Econometrica, 70, 1741\textendash 1779), we offer such foundations and use them to quantify the importance of Ricardian comparative advantage. In the process, we also provide a theoretically consistent alternative to Balassa's (1965, "An Empirical Demonstration of Classical Comparative Cost Theory", Review of Economics and Statistics, 45, 231\textendash 238) well-known index of "revealed comparative advantage".]},

  year = {2004},
  abstract = {"Openness to trade is one factor that has been identified as determining whether a country is prone to sudden stops in capital inflow, currency crashes, or severe recessions. Some believe that openness raises vulnerability to foreign shocks, while others believe that it makes adjustment to crises less painful. Several authors have offered empirical evidence that having a large tradable sector reduces the contraction necessary to adjust to a given cut-off in funding. This would help explain lower vulnerability to crises in Asia than in Latin America. Such studies may, however, be subject to the problem that trade is endogenous. We use the gravity instrument for trade openness, which is constructed from geographical determinants of bilateral trade. We find that openness indeed makes countries less vulnerable, both to severe sudden stops and currency crashes, and that the relationship is even stronger when correcting for the endogeneity of trade"--National Bureau of Economic Research web site.},

Working through the first principles of the methodology from Leamer (1981), this paper analyzes and improves the technique to provide a unified estimator of import supply and demand elasticities. The proposed LIML routine corrects small sample biases and constrained search inefficiencies. Previously used estimates are shown to overestimate the median elasticity of substitution by over 35\%. Applied to US import data from 1993 to 2007, the biases of the standard estimates translate into an understatement of consumer gains from product variety by a factor of 6. To conclude, I investigate the implications of violations to the underlying assumptions of the model.},
